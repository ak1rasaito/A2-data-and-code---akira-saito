## General Info
A primary-school-aged children's plush toy which fosters an environment in which children are encouraged to practice self-confidence and words of positive affirmation. The project uses Python language and the MicroBit along with some accessories. 

### Project Status
Project is: _no longer being worked on._

The software for Prototype 1.2 is _complete_, however time and resources have hindered the hardware and project completion. 

## Launch
The following is a list of everything needed to launch:
* Plush toy
* MicroBit V2
* 2 x crocodile leads
* Pin/Push button
* Small foam block

For Prototype 1.2, you will need an additional:
* An external storage device (such as a SD card)
* Audio files in 7812 Hz and Unsigned 8-bit PCM format (see uploaded files)

## Features 
This prototype features an external push button, allowing you to place the button anywhere within the toy (as long as in reach of crocodile leads). The phrases can also be randomised, and the toy giggles when shaken!

## Technologies 
Languages and libraries used:
* Python language
* Microbit Development library
  * Random
  * Speech
  * Audio
  * Sound Effects

## Further Development
Prototype 1 could be further developed by refining the speech function or adding an external speaker for louder volume

Prototype 1.2 could be further developed with an additive of an external storage device, such as a SD card. 

## Set Up
1. Complete wiring of MicroBit to battery pack and pin button outside of the toy.
2. Remove stitching on back of plush toy and remove stuffing to gain access to needed areas (i.e. limbs, tummy area).
3. Place pin button to an easily accessible area, and place foam block behind button to allow for harder surface area to push against.
4. Place MicroBit V2 at the front of the bear, and ensure no stuffing blocks the MicroBit and surface fabric of toy. This reduces noise blockage.
5. Test if working (including button and shake function).
6. Sew toy back to original form.

## Sources 
This toy is inspired by the thousands of audio incorporated toys on the market. 

The audio retrival portion of my Prototype 1.2 code was guided by MicroBit's support blog (https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/articles/19000125318-playing-audio-on-the-micro-bit)
